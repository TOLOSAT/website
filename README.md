It will be kept here for legacy's sake.

Welcome to the official website of TOLOSAT. If you are interested in
contributing, please refer to our [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## ⚙️ Requirements

You need to install the latest Node.js version and npm to run the website. You
can download both [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To get autocompletion and a nice code environment, I recommend
> using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install **workspace
> recommended extensions** in the extension panel.

## ⚡️ Quick Usage

To quickly run the website, you need to know the following commands:

| Command         | Description                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies             |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts the development server     |
| `npm run build` | Builds the project for production |

> [!TIP]
> I recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) instead of
> **npm** to save disk space and boost installation speed. More information
> [here](https://pnpm.io/motivation).
